    \section{resources}

    Specifies all the data that are not widgets of the \acrref{UI}. The folder contains data like the cursors icons, the \genie{} dat files.

    \subsection{\_common}

    This is the main folder of \textbf{resources} directory.

    \subsubsection{cursors}

    List of all the cursors the cursor directed by the user mouse will display when a given action is performed. For instance, when you need to garrison a villager, a specific cursor image replace the classic arrow icon. All the cursors image have the \code{cur} extension.

    \subsubsection{dat}

    Contains the dat files containing all the information regarding units, civilization, buildings: \code{empires2\_x2\_p1.dat} contains all such information. \footnote{The file can be opened by \genie{}}

    \subsubsection{drs}

    \paragraph{gamedata\_x2}

    This important folder contains \acrref{RMS} files that can be used in your \acrref{RMS} programming (\eg{} \code{F\_Season.inc}). See Appendix \ref{chp:rms}.

    \section{widgetui}

    Specifies which set of textures \aoe{} needs to display alongside their configuration. If you need to alter a picture, it will probably be here.
    Contains a set of json.
    Furthermore, it contains a folder named \dquote{textures}, representing all the textures and images in the game. There are versions, \textit{textures} and \textit{textures-sd}: the former contains the texture to use and the latter contains the low resolution version of the same textures. The first texture are mandatory while the second are optional (modwise). All textures are saved via \acrref{DDS} extensions.\footnote{You can use \code{Irfan View} 32-bit version to view \acrref{DDS} images.}

    \code{Textures} folder contains other folders:

    \subsection{atlas} 

    Contains textures that are present in the Campaigns menu (\eg{} the scenes where you can choose which campaign to play), Sun Tzu icons in the \dquote{Art of War}, images representing the \acrref{UI} you see while playing (\figref{fig:CivAsia}), the window chat, buildings icons (\figref{fig:ingamebuildings}).

    \chapter{Advance Genie Editor}
    \label{chp:genieeditor}

    This is a small guide to \genie{} software. The guide is based on version 2020.3.30. You should not consider this guide as something as official. \genie{} is a program for editing data of genie (\acrref{DAT} and \acrref{DLL}) files. It can edit properties of units, civilizations, technologies, graphics, terrains, sounds, player colors and some other things\cite{TurnupHyperion4:2019}.
    \genie{} program can be found in \aoeexedir{}, under \dquote{Tools\_Build} directory.

    When you execute it three windows automatically open. The \textit{Open files...} allows you to open a \genie{} file. To manage \aoe{} files, click on the button \textit{Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition} on the right of \textit{Defaults:} label. Set the \textit{Genie version:} to \textit{Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition}.
    The file that you need to open is the one specified by \textit{Compressed data set (*.dat)}: such a file should be called \code{empires2\_x2\_p1.dat}. When you open such a file you can view all the unit, buildings, civilizations parameters and properties. The vanilla file is \code{C:\textbackslash{}Program Files (x86)\textbackslash{}Steam\textbackslash{}steamapps\textbackslash{}common\textbackslash{}AoE2DE\textbackslash{}resources\_common\textbackslash{}dat\textbackslash{}empires2\_x2\_p1.dat}.

    After opening the file, you can now make changes on the file. \figref{fig:genie01} shows the state fo the program when it opens the file. 

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/images/genie01}
        \caption{Standard \genie{} window}
        \label{fig:genie01}
    \end{figure}

    As shown in \figref{fig:genie03}, \genie{} splits its parameters regarding the \aoe{} field.

    \begin{info}
        You can switch between tabs by the performing hotkeys \code{Ctrl + Pag. Up} and \code{Ctrl + Pag. Down}.
    \end{info}

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/images/genie03}
        \caption{Standard \genie{} window. The red box highlights the category tabs grouping the parameters you can tweak according to the \aoe{} field.}
        \label{fig:genie03}
    \end{figure}

    In the units left pane (called \dquote{Units}) there is displayed the list of all the units a particular civilization can manage (\eg{} in \figref{fig:genie02} the civ is \dquote{Gaia}). Since the unit tabs show several parameters and unit, you can filter the units using the search box in the units pane (\eg{} \figref{fig:genie02} highlighted in the red box).

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/images/genie02}
        \caption{Standard \genie{} window. The red box highlights the search boxes you can use to filter }
        \label{fig:genie02}
    \end{figure}

    The search box works as follows: first you select the civilization, then you can add at most 2 criteria involving the unit name (in and with the civilization): namely, if the 2 criteria are $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ and the civilization involved is $c$, the whole search criterion is $civ = c \land (\gamma_1 \in unit.name) \land (\gamma_2 \in unit.name)$, where $unit.name$ is the string representing a generic unit name. For instance, if $\gamma_{1} = dead$ then we select all the units whose name contains the substring \dquote{dead}. You can add \dquote{|} to perform a logical or ($\squote{\lor}$) inside $\gamma_{i}$ ($i \in \{1,2\}$). For instance if $\gamma_{1} = \_D|dead$, the global search criterion is $civ = c \land ((\_D \in unit.name) \lor (dead \in unit.name))$: such a search query will generate all the units whose name contains either \dquote{\_D} or \dquote{dead}.

    You can select multiple units: when you alter a value from the unit pane, the same parameter will be updated also in every other civilization checked in the top checkboxes (\eg{}, \dquote{Ga}, \dquote{Br}, \dquote{Fr}, \dquote{Go}). At the bottom you can see how many changes performed in this session (as shown in \figref{fig:bottombar}).

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{src/images/bottom-bar}
        \caption{Example of how the bottom bar can be used to check how many changes we have made so far.}
        \label{fig:bottombar}
    \end{figure}

    \section{Required Knowledge}

    \paragraph{Unit names.}
    The units ending with \dquote{\_D} represent the corpses of the associated unit: for instance \dquote{Archer} unit is the actual unit with all its properties while \dquote{ARCHR\_D} represents the archer corpse.

    \paragraph{Buildings.} Every time the user access to a new era, each building changes. For instance, in \textit{graphics} you can see that there are, for each stable building civ, a stable for feudal, one for the castle age and another one for the imperial age.

    \section{Units parameters}

    Manage a single unit parameters. This section is divided in multiple sub areas:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Language Files;
        \item Graphics;
        \item Statistics;
        \item Projectiles;
        \item Attributes;
        \item Sounds;
        \item Tasks;
    \end{itemize}

    The documentation in this area has been copied from \cite{agewiki:2014}.

    \subsection{Language Files}

    \subsection{Graphics}

    \subsection{Statistics}

    \textbf{Hit Points}: hit points of the unit. If -1, the unit will immediately die\cite{genie:hitpoints}. \textbf{Speed}: the speed of the unit. \textbf{Rotation Speed} makes the unit slower. \textbf{Line of Sight} represents the number of cells the unit can see. Generates a circle centered in the unit. \textbf{Search Radius} is determines the area within which the unit will recognizes and react to other units.  If anything enters this area, the unit will notice it; If you enter a value higher than LOS, a unit will chase enemy units outside of its sight range. \textbf{Min Range} (\textbf{max Range}) represents the minimum (maximum) range the ranged unit can shoot its projectile: for example an archer can shoot any target between 0 and 4 cells\cite{agewiki:2014}.

    \textbf{Resource capacity} determines the quantity of resources a unit can hold (in range $[0, 3392]$): for villagers, this is the max amount of resources they can carry. For other units, it can be other resources, like the time it takes for a dead unit to decompose\cite{agewiki:2014}.

    \textbf{Resource Decay} determines how fast objects (like corpses) decay. Set -1 for never decaying. A negative value will prevent the corpse from decaying permanently. The larger a positive value is, the longer the corpse will last. (The value is approximately the equivalent number of game seconds). Many non-corpse units have resource decay value, but the purpose of it in other units is unknown\cite{agewiki:2014}. 

    \textbf{Work Rate} determines the base work speed of units. This affects rates like villager work rates (building, gathering, etc.), conversion speed, and trebuchet pack (unpack) speed. the value needs to satisfy the constraint $x \geq 0$\cite{agewiki:2014}.

    \textbf{Garrison Capacity} is the number of units a transport or building can hold. allowed value $x$ must satisfy the constraint $x \in [-1, 127]$. Only rams, buildings, and transport ships can normally hold units. \footnote{Garrisoning infantry into rams will increase both the ram's speed and attack.} If you give a rams an original speed of 0, garrisoning units will allow it to move. 

    \textbf{Garrison type} determines what units can garrison into the building ($x \in [0, 15]$). Such a integer value should be interpreted as an enumeration, which semantic is shown in \tblref{tbl:garrisontype}. The number are encoded in \genie{} as a 8-bit value\cite{agewiki:2014}.

    \begin{table}[ht]
        \centering

            \toprule

        \caption{Semantic of each Garrison Type value.}
        \label{tbl:garrisontype}
    \end{table}

    \textbf{Garrison Heal Rate} determines how fast a building heals units garrisoned within it ($x \geq 0$). This is different from the Garrison Recovery, which determines how fast the unit heals when garrisoned in any building\cite{agewiki:2014}.

    \chapter{\acrref{RMS} file format and layout}
    \label{chp:rms}

    \acrref{RMS} files are used to generate random maps that follows some specific pattern. Random maps change each time you play since they are randomly generated starting from a seed $s$. Examples of such maps are \textit{Black Forest} or \textit{Scandinavia}. 
    If you need to create a new type of random map, you need to provide a \code{rms} file. \code{rms} files are written by using a language (called \textit{rms}) created by the developers of \aoe{}\cite{rms:2019}. This section will describes you a \acrref{RMS} file is structured. This section is based on the guide made by Ryan Andrews\cite{rms:2019} and by \cite{zetnus:2019}.

    At high level, a \acrref{RMS} file has 7 basic sections:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item PLAYER\_SETUP;
        \item LAND\_GENERATION;
        \item ELEVATION\_GENERATION;
        \item CLIFF\_GENERATION;
        \item TERRAIN\_GENERATION;
        \item CONNECTION\_GENERATION;
        \item OBJECTS\_GENERATION;
    \end{enumerate}

    As an example, consider \lstref{lst:teamarena} made by vierklee, which represents a random map which create an area where all the teams are located behind procedurally generated walls.

    \lstinputlisting[language={ebnf},label=lst:teamarena,caption={The full source code of the rms file which generates the team maps \dquote{team arena}.}, float, frame=ht]{src/codes/folder-structure.txt}

    At high level, in a \code{rms} file comments follows \code{C} conventions (\ie{} comments start with \dquote{/* } and end with \dquote{ */}). Each section starts with a \textbf{section declaration} and is followed by a section body. Each section declaration follow the regular expression \verb|<[a-zA-Z0-9_]+>\n|. \lstref{lst:rms:regex} specifies the \acrref{EBNF} of the \acrref{RMS} language. The language is case-sensitive and indendation is ignored\cite{zetnus:2019}.

    \lstinputlisting[language={rms},label=lst:rms:regex,caption={EBNF-like statements representing the language of the rms file.}, float, frame=ht]{src/codes/rms-file.txt}

    \section{\acrref{RMS} control flow}

    \subsection{Conditional flow}

    In \acrref{RMS} conditional flow (\ie{} \code{if}, \code{then}, \code{else}) are implemented via the keywords \code{if}, \code{elseif}, \code{else}, \code{endif}. Both \code{elseif} and \code{else} are optiional.
    \lstref{lst:if} shows an example of how to use the conditional flow.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms}, label={lst:if}]
        if FOOBAR
            /* do something when FOOBAR preprocessor directive is specified */
        elseif FOOBAZ
            /* do something when FOOBAZ preprocessor directive is specified */
        else
            /* do something else */
        endif
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{\#include\_drs}

    Include a file located in a given folder. If the filepath is relative, it is relative to the folder \aoeexedir{}\verb|\resources\_common\drs\gamedata_x2| (\eg{} \verb|C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\resources\_common\drs\gamedata_x2|). Inside such a folder, you can several include files that you can use to ease your rms programming. The content of the included file will be dumped as-is in the current file.

    \subsection{\#const}

    \code{C}-like preprocessor. Every time the application see the identifier, it will be replaced by the associated value.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms}, label={lst:const}]
        #const ANSWER 42
    \end{lstlisting}

    For example, in \lstref{lst:const} the statement allows the program to replace \code{ANSWER} with the string 42.

    \section{\acrref{RMS} file sections}

    In the following, we will describe each section. 

    \subsection{PLAYER\_SETUP}

    \paragraph{Player placement}

    In \code{PLAYER\_SETUP} we need to first choose how the players starting position are put in the map. So, you need to put one of the following specifications:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{random\_placement}: players are positioned in a circle/oval. This is the default value;
        \item \textbf{grouped\_by\_team}: players are positioned in close proximity to each other. Distance between team members is double the \term{base\_size} used in \term{create\_plater\_lands};
        \item \textbf{direct\_placement}: Allows to manually set the player positions. via create\_land attribute in \term{LAND\_GENERATION}. For example in \lstref{label=rms:manualposition} the first player is positioned in the middle of the map.
        
            \begin{lstlisting}[language=rms,label=rms:manualposition]
                <PLAYER_SETUP>
                direct_placement
                <LAND_GENERATION>
                create_land {
                        terrain_type DESERT
                        land_percent 3
                        land_position 50 50
                        assign_to_player 1
                }
            \end{lstlisting}
        
    \end{itemize}

    If you plan to make the map as a nomad map, you should set the command \term{nomad\_resources}: this will add the cost fo a town center to each player.

    \paragraph{ai\_info\_map\_type}

    Next thing you can set is the \acrref{AI} that \aoe{} will use in the map. You can see as a hint that \aoe{} will use. Such an hint is declared via command \term{ai\_info\_map\_type}. The signature of the command is the one shown in \lstref{rms:setai}, where:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=rms,label=rms:setai]
        ai_info_map_type MapType IsNomad IsMIchi ShowType
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item MapType is the map type constants (see \sectionref{subsection:maptype});
        \item IsNomad either 1 or 0: if you plan to make the map as \dquote{nomad}, you are \textbf{required} to set this value to 1;
        \item IsMichi: either 1 or 0: if true a forest will \textbf{completely} separating the players;
        \item ShowType: either 1 or 0: if true, the map type will be shown in the objective tab;
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{LAND\_GENERATION}

    Place some large areas of terrain in the map. For instance, some maps have some texture representing ground at each player starting location while the rest of the map is filled with grass. This section of the file performs this very feature.

    The first to declare in this section is the type of the terrain you want to have, which can be achieved by using \term{base\_terrain} command. Such a command requires a single input, which should be fetched from the terrain types (see Appendix \ref{subsection:terraintype}).

    Now you need to create large pieces of terrains on the maps. Terrain maps can be used to create a walkable texture at the starting position of a player or a lake in the center like the baltic map\cite{zetnus:2015}.

    \subsubsection{create\_player\_lands}

    The command allows you to create a specific \textbf{land} terrain for \textbf{every} player in the map. This command applies to all the players present in the map. If you want to assign different terrains to different players, consider using \term{create\_land} with \term{assign\_to\_player} instead. The command is optional in the script. If the command can be used multiple times, but every player will have multiple town centers as well as result: this is probably how map \dquote{Budapest} is coded. Note that you give to a player any land, you cannot give to her any starting units or resources as well, so it is \textbf{very important} that each player has at least one starting land.

    \begin{attention}
        \term{create\_player\_lands} cannot be used, due to a bug, alongside \term{direct\_placement}.
    \end{attention}

    \lstref{lst:create-land-player}  shows an example of usage of the command. It will create, for each player, some mass of initial land for the players, where\cite{forgotten-empires:rms-features}:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=rms,label={lst:create-land-player},caption={Example of usage of \term{create\_player\_lands} in Team Arean by vierklee.}]
        create_player_lands 
        { 
            terrain_type                     GRASS 
            base_size                        19
            land_percent			 5
            clumping_factor                  3
            border_fuzziness                 15
            set_zone_by_team
            other_zone_avoidance_distance    0
            circle_placement
            circle_radius 38
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \figref{fig:create-player-lands} shows how teamless map generates each player starting position base.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{src/images/create-player-lands}
        \caption{Example of how players are laid out in a map is automatic placement is used.}
        \label{fig:create-player-lands}
    \end{figure}

    The command requires several parameters, which are described next.
    
    \paragraph{\term{terrain\_type}}
    the terrain you want to generate. See \sectionref{subsection:terraintype}.

    \paragraph{\term{land\_percent}}
    Percentage of the total map that the land to create should cover. the number belongs to the range $[0,100]$ (default to 100). If used in \term{create\_player\_lands}, the percentage is divided equally by all the players.

    \paragraph{\term{number\_of\_tiles}}
    Fixed number of tiles that the land should grow by, in addition to the land specified by \term{base\_size}. When \term{behavior\_version} is set to 1, the square origin is included in the total number of tiles, resulting in smaller lands. If used in \term{create\_player\_lands}, the player share the same amount of number of tiles.

    \paragraph{\term{land\_position}}
    Allows you to specify the exact origin point for a land, as a percentage of the total map dimensions. It requires 2 parameters $x$ and $y$ which are, respectively, the x coordinate from the left point to the right and the y coordinate from the bottom to the top of the starting point. You need to satisfy the constraint $x \in [0,100]$, $y \in [0, 99]$. The command cannot be specified when added into \term{create\_player\_lands} or when \term{assign\_to\_player} or \term{assign\_to} is specified into \term{create\_land} (unless \term{direct\_placement} is specified in \term{PLAYER\_SETUP}). The command ignores border restrictions and, if the land is placed outside the border, it will not grow beyond its \term{base\_size}.

    \paragraph{\term{left\_border}, \term{right\_border}, \term{top\_border}, \term{bottom\_border}}
    All needs to satisfy the constraint $x \in [0,97]$, default to $0$. They specify an subset of the map where the land will be put. For instance, this allows the developer to put the players only in the bottom right part of the map (\eg{} in Pilgrims); in \term{create\_player\_lands}, the border coordinates effectively shift the circle where the players are put; when using this function, the created land will have octoagonal shape. For further information, see \url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_I1I9u-hI2FFm-EYyjoM_-9dNJFOfTaIgr05wXNbdpv9tI18b6r18ARULy3Jqyvlq6-lc2VjX6xP4/pub#h.xrncn5cs75or}.

    \paragraph{\term{set\_zone\_by\_team}}

    \paragraph{\term{base\_size}}
    It is the radius (in tiles) that each player starting position land will have, in map cells; The bigger it is, the bigger is each player base.

    \paragraph{\term{circle\_radius}}
    It represents the radius of the circle where each player base will be placed. The bigger it is, the more distant each player will be \wrt{}the other ones. The players are put on the circonference of said circle; You need to specify 2 numbers $a$ and $b$: if $a \not = b$, it is produced an ellipse instead of a circle; If $a=b$, $b$ may not be specified.

    \paragraph{\term{circle\_placement}}

    \paragraph{\term{border\_fuzziness}}
    It applies some noise to each player starting land borders ($x \in [0, 100]$). Values near 0 corresponds to perfectly rectangular bases while bigger values tends to create bases with a square-less shape. A good value may be 15; \term{border\_fuzziness} Specifies the extent to which land growth respects the assigned borders. Bigger values means that the borders are fully respected while values near 0 means that the generated area may go beyond the specified border.

    \paragraph{\term{clumping\_factor}}
    Alters the shape of the created land ($x \in [0, 100]$). High values represent rounder lands while low values represents more elongated shapes\cite{zetnus:2019,userpatch15}.

    \paragraph{\term{base\_elevation}}
    elevates the entire land by the specified height ($x \in [0, 9]$). The value is ignore if the terrain is water. Slopes are automatically added to blend the elevation with the sorrounding terrain.

    \paragraph{\term{assign\_to\_player}}
    give ownership of this land to the given player. Allowed values are $x \in [1,8]$ (which are the player lobby positional number). If missing, the land is neutral. Lands assigned to players which are not playing will not be created. Mutually exclusive with \term{assign\_to}.

    \paragraph{\term{assign\_to}}
    Given ownership of this land to the given entity. Mutually exclusive with \term{assign\_to\_player}. It requires 4 additional arguments.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item AssignTarget, which tells which entity will take ownership of the land. Can be either \term{AT\_PLAYER}, \term{AT\_COLOR} or \term{AT\_TEAM};
        \item Number $x$: represents the specific entity Id of AssignTarget $t \in {0,1,2}$. If $t=\mbox{AT-PLAYER}$ (0), $x \in [1,8]$ (refers to the lobby order); if $t=\mbox{AT-COLOR}$ (1), $x \in [1,8]$ (refers to the player color); If $t=\mbox{AT-TEAM}$ (2), $x \in \{-10,-4,-3-,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4\}$ (refers to the lobby order of the team, not the number chosen by the team): in this cse is the team 0 refers to unteamed players, while any negative value $x$ represents a player that is not in the team whose lobby order is $-x$. Team -10 is a special team that consists to any player;
        \item Mode $m$: semanticful only if AssignTarget si set to \term{AT\_TEAM}. either -1 or 0. $0$ means the land is assigned randomly in the team while $-1$ means that the land is assigned in an orderly matter;
        \item Flag $f \in [0,3]$. It is a 2-bit biset number. First bit determines if we need to reset players who have already been assigned before startign whiel the second bit tells to avoid remembering the fact that we have assign to a given player this land;
    \end{enumerate}

    When you assign a piece of land to a player, you can also place object owned by such a player. Lands owned by players which are not playing are not generated at all. 

    \paragraph{\term{zone}}

    Allows the land you are creating to be assigned with a particular \textbf{zone id}. Lands which share the same zone id are allwoed to touch eacother when growing. If 2 lands that are going to overlap have different zone ids, will be forbidden to do so: even better, they are garantueed to be distant by \term{other\_zone\_avoidance\_distance}. The command is mutually exclusive with \term{set\_zone\_by\_team} and with \term{set\_zone\_randomly}. Lands created with \term{create\_player\_lands} have their own unique zone id, while all lands created with \term{create\_land} share the same zone id.

    \begin{attention}
        Zone 99 will crash the game.
    \end{attention}

    \paragraph{\term{set\_zone\_by\_team}}

    Assign the same zone to all the members of the same team. Usage is recommended only in \term{create\_player\_lands}.

    \paragraph{\term{set\_zone\_randomly}}

    TODO

    \paragraph{\term{other\_zone\_avoidance\_distance}}
    Number of cells that each starting player position needs be distant from the other zones. If such a value is set to 0, each starting position base may overlap with others (like in Team Arena by vierklee).

    \paragraph{\term{min\_placement\_distance}}

    \paragraph{\term{land\_id}}

    Assign a numeric label to a land, which can later be used to place object specifically on that land via \term{place\_on\_specific\_land\_id} command. Multiple lands may share the same ID. The commands needs to be used after \term{assign\_to\_player} or \term{assign\_to}, since they will reset the ID.

    \paragraph{create\_land}

    Creates a single piece of land which is owned by no players. Hence it can be used to place neutral mass of lands (\eg{} shared continent or shared{} center lakes, like in Baltic).
    As an example, consider \lstref{lst:create-land}: the example create a lake centered in the middle of the map. The lake itself covers 20\% of the map

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=rms,label={lst:create-land},caption={Example of usage of \term{create\_land} in Team Arean by vierklee.}]

        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{\term{CLIFF\_GENERATION}}

    Thanks to this section, cliffs are added in the map\cite{aok:cliffs, zetnus:2015}.
    Cliffs are generated \textit{after} lands but \textit{before} terrain. If the section declaration is left empty, some cliff are still generated on the map.
    To further customize the cliffs, you need to input other commands.

    \paragraph{\term{min\_number\_of\_cliffs}}

    The mininum number of cliffs to generate. It requires the number of minimum cliffs to generate. For instance, in \lstref{lst:minimumnumberofcliffs} we generate at least 10 cliffs.

    \begin{lstlisting}{language=rms, label={lst:minimumnumberofcliffs}}
        <CLIFF_GENERATION>
        min_number_of_cliffs 10
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{warning}
        If you put a large number of cliffs, the number of cliffs will be truncated if there is not enough space in the map.
    \end{warning}

    \paragraph{\term{max\_number\_of\_cliffs}}

    The maximum number of cliffs to generate. It requires the number of maximum cliffs to generate. For instance, in \lstref{lst:minimumnumberofcliffs} we generate at most 10 cliffs.

    \begin{lstlisting}{language=rms, label={lst:minimumnumberofcliffs}}
        <CLIFF_GENERATION>
        max_number_of_cliffs 10
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{min\_distance\_cliffs}}

    The minimum number of \textbf{cliff unit} that separates one cliff to another one. It accepts a single number $x \geq 0$, whose default value is 2.

    \begin{definition}
        A cliff unit corresponds to 3 map tiles.
    \end{definition}

    \paragraph{\term{min\_length\_of\_cliff} and \term{max\_length\_of\_cliff}}

    The minimum (and the maximum) length of a generic cliff. Note that you are required to satisfy $min \geq max, min \geq 0, max \geq 0$.

    \paragraph{\term{cliff\_curliness}}

    Determines how much the cliffs tends to change directions ($x \in [0, 100]$). At 0, cliffs will be very straight and at 100 they will be extremely twisted. For example in \lstref{lst:cliffcurliness} we will generate exactly 20 cliffs, which are a bit \dquote{curly}.

    \begin{lstlisting}{language=rms, label={lst:cliffcurliness}}
        <CLIFF_GENERATION>
        min_number_of_cliffs 20
        max_number_of_cliffs 20
        cliff_curliness  10
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{\term{TERRAIN\_GENERATION}}

    Replace terrains with other terrains. It is usually used to place clumps of forest, adding textures to make the map more nice, adding small lakes into chunks of forests and so on. The main command you should use here is \term{create\_terrain}, although you can also use the following commands:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \term{color\_correction};
    \end{itemize}



    \subsubsection{\term{color\_correction}}

    Specify a color correction to the whole map. Within the game, such an option is available via \dquote{Map Lightning}. The command accepts a single argument $x$, which can be one of the following: \code{CC\_AUTUMN}, \code{CC\_WINTER}, \code{CC\_JUNGLE}, \code{CC\_DESERT}.

    \subsubsection{\term{create\_terrain} TERRAIN}

    Create a single piece of terrain. Depending on which terrain you add in the map, the behavior may change. It accepts a lot of arguments, hence we will deal with them in several paragraphs.

    \paragraph{\term{base\_terrain} TERRAIN}

    It performs like the argument in the land generation.

    \begin{attention}
        Due to a bug, the value does not default to \term{GRASS}.
    \end{attention}

    \paragraph{\term{terrain\_mask} NUM}

    Enables terramin masking or layering for the terrain being created. The terrain to add inherits all properties, placement restrictions, automatic objects (\eg{} trees for forest terrains or minimap color) from the base terrain. This function is great to blend terrains in order to create more realistic and aesthetically pleasant maps. The only argument is the layer number, which can either 0 (no masking), 1 or 2. Setting the layer to 1 means that the new terrain is masked \textit{above} the base terrain ajnd inherits its properties. On the other hand, setting the layer to 2 means that the terrain to ad is placed \textit{below} the base terrain: in this case the base terrain will inherits the properties from the terrain just added.

    \begin{note}
        Terrain will have animated water if any of the terrains are water.
    \end{note}

    \paragraph{\term{spacing\_to\_other\_terrain\_types} NUM}

    Minimum distance that this terrain will stay away from other terrain types. It requires a number $x \geq 0$ (default to 0). This value considers only the terrains already present. The command will ignore terrain sharing the same terrain type. If \term{set\_flat\_terrain\_only}, the terrain will distance that the terrain will stay away from slopes.

    \paragraph{\term{set\_flat\_terrain\_only}}

    Command the map generation to avoid slopes tiles by the distance specified by the only argument $x$, $x \geq 1$. \lstref{lst:flatterrainonly} shows an example where the generator creates a hill where the bottom and the top are desert, but the slopes are grass.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:flatterrainonly}]
        <ELEVATION_GENERATION>
        create_elevation 7 {
            base_terrain GRASS
            number_of_tiles 3000
            number_of_clumps 1
        }

        <TERRAIN_GENERATION>
        create_terrain DESERT {
            base_terrain GRASS
            land_percent 100
            number_of_clumps 9320
            spacing_to_other_terrain_types 1
            set_flat_terrain_only
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{land\_percent} NUM}

    Percentage of the total map allocated to this \term{create\_terrain} command. If \term{number\_of\_clumps} is specified, this value is divided equally among the clumps. \lstref{lst:createterrain} contains an example where a a desert covers 50\% of the map. The terrain will only be replaced where the appropriate \term{base\_terrain} or \term{base\_layer} is present, and will only replace the specified number of individual clumps, so it will not necessarily fill 100\% of the map if set to 100.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:createterrain}]
        <TERRAIN_GENERATION>
        create_terrain DESERT {
            base_terrain GRASS
            land_percent 50
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{number\_of\_tiles} NUM}

    Total time count allocate dto this \term{create\_terrain} command. If \term{number\_of\_clumps} is specified, this value is divided equally among the clumps.

    \paragraph{\term{number\_of\_clumps} NUM}

    TODO

    \paragraph{\term{clumping\_factor} NUM}

    TODO

    \paragraph{\term{set\_scale\_by\_size}}

    Scales \term{number\_of\_tiles} to the map size. Unscaled value refers to a 100x100 map (see: \tblref{tbl:size}). If you see a script scaling by both size and groups, only the final attribute will apply! If you want to scale by both groups and size, use \term{set\_scale\_by\_groups} instead. \lstref{lst:setscalebysize} contains an example where the map generator creates 4 lakes which become larger on larger maps; on a small map this will be 4 clumps with a total of $400 \cdot 2.1 = 840$ tiles. The command is mutually exclusive with \term{set\_scale\_by\_groups}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:setscalebysize}]
        <TERRAIN_GENERATION>
        create_terrain WATER {
            base_terrain GRASS
            number_of_clumps 4
            number_of_tiles 400
            set_scale_by_size
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{set\_scale\_by\_groups}}

    Scales \term{number\_of\_clumps} to the map size. Unscaled value refers to a 100x100 map (see \tblref{tbl:size}). If you see a script scaling by both size and groups, only the final attribute will apply! When used with \term{number\_of\_tiles}, the total tiles are also scaled to map size as well (but only for terrains, not for elevation). For example, \lstref{lst:setscalebygroups} allows to  Create 400 tiles worth of lakes, with the number of lakes \textit{and} the total number of tiles scaling to map size. On a small map this will be 4x2.1 = 8 clumps with a total of $400 \cdot 2.1 = 840$ tiles.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:setscalebygroups}]
        <TERRAIN_GENERATION>
        create_terrain WATER {
            base_terrain GRASS
            number_of_clumps 4
            number_of_tiles 400
            set_scale_by_groups
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{set\_avoid\_player\_start\_areas}}

    \paragraph{\term{height\_limits} NUM NUM}

    The terrain will only be placed on tiles of height between min and max (inclusive). For most purposes, values between 0 and 7 are useful, where 0 being the standard non-elevated height and 7 being the max height that can be produced by \term{create\_elevation}. For example \lstref{lst:heightslimits} allows you to create a hill and place desert terrain only on the slopes.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:heightslimits}]
        <ELEVATION_GENERATION>
            create_elevation 7 {
            base_terrain GRASS
            number_of_tiles 3000
            number_of_clumps 1
        }

        <TERRAIN_GENERATION>
            create_terrain DESERT {
            base_terrain GRASS
            land_percent 100
            number_of_clumps 9320
            height_limits 1 6
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{\term{CONNECTION\_GENERATION}}

    The section allows to replace terrains with other terrains, specifically along a given pah between the origins of lands. Used to create roads between players, shallows area across rivers and to ensure that forests do not completely separate players. If a connection provided by the \acrref{RMS} file is not possible, it is skipped.  Each commands creates several connections between points and perform an action over the terrains.

    Each command can be associated to several attributes, which are described below:

    \paragraph{\term{default\_terrain\_replacement} TERRAIN}

    Replace all the terrains in the connections with the specified terrain.

    \paragraph{\term{replace\_terrain} TERRAIN1 TERRAIN2}

    If the terrain \code{TERRAIN1} is part of a connection, replace it with the terrain \code{TERRAIN2}. Can be used multiple times for different terrains.

    \begin{attention}
        The terrain \code{TERRAIN1} refers to the terrain that the map generator detects it at the beginning of the \code{CONNECTIOn\_GENERATION} section.
    \end{attention}

    \paragraph{\term{terrain\_cost} TERRAIN NUM}

    The cost of having the connection run through the specified terrain. This allows the path finding algorithm \cite{dijkstra1959a} to alter the optimal solution. If the terrain is the one \code{TERRAIN}, the cost of such edges are temporary set to \code{NUM} instead of 1. $NUM > 0$. \lstref{lst:replacecost} shows an example of how to use this attribute.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:replacecost}]
        <CONNECTION_GENERATION>
        create_connect_all_players_land {
            replace_terrain GRASS ROAD
            replace_terrain FOREST LEAVES
            replace_terrain WATER SHALLOW
            replace_terrain MED_WATER SHALLOW
            replace_terrain DEEP_WATER SHALLOW
            terrain_cost GRASS 1
            terrain_cost FOREST 7
            terrain_cost WATER 7
            terrain_cost MED_WATER 12
            terrain_cost DEEP_WATER 15
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{terrain\_size} TERRAIN NUM NUM}

    When a connection passes through a tile of the specified terrain, the area within radius +/- variance will be subject to \term{replace\_terrain} or \term{default\_terrain\_replacement} and terrains will be replaced accordingly. \lstref{lst:terrainsize} shows an example of how to use this attribute: the roads are slightly larger. The first argument represents the radius of the road we are building while the second parameter represents the variance of the radius of the road we are building.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms},label={lst:terrainsize}]
        <CONNECTION_GENERATION>
        create_connect_all_players_land {
            replace_terrain GRASS ROAD
            replace_terrain WATER SHALLOW
            terrain_size GRASS 1 1
            terrain_size WATER 3 1
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{\term{create\_connect\_all\_players\_land}}

    Create several connection in order to make sure that all lands of players (both the starting ones and the ones assigned to them) are reachable. Each connection edge $(u,v)$, where $u,v$ represent two players. An example of the connection generated are shown in \figref{fig:createconnectallplayersland}.

    \subsubsection{\term{create\_connect\_teams\_lands}}

    Create several connections. Each connection edge $(u,v)$, where $u,v$ represent two players starting position belonging to the same team. An example of the connection generated are shown in \figref{fig:createconnectteamslands}. The road generated may go into enemy teams or neutral teams as well, if the connection is the optimal one.

    \subsubsection{\term{create\_connect\_all\_lands}}

    Connections will be generated in order to connect all the lands present on the map.

    \subsubsection{\term{create\_connect\_same\_land\_zones}}

    Apparently the same of \term{create\_connect\_all\_lands}.

    \subsubsection{\term{create\_connect\_to\_nonplayer\_land}}

    Connect all player lands to all neutral lands, but do not directly generate connections between individual players.

    \subsection{\term{OBJECTS\_GENERATION}}

    This section deals when placing buildings, units, resources, animals, straggler trees, decorations and other stuffs. Objects are placed in the same order as they appear in the \acrref{RMS} file. Normally, each tile can contains at most 1 object. If the object cannot be placed, it is not generated at all. The command that places objects is performed via \term{create\_object} command.

    \begin{note}
        Consider placing first the most important objects.
    \end{note}

    The attributes of \term{create\_object} are shown below (since they are many).

    \paragraph{\term{number\_of\_objects} NUM}

    Number of objects to places in the whole map. The num needs to $x \in [1, 9320]$. \lstref{lst:numerofobjects} allows to generate 10 batches of gold mines in the whole map.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms}, label={lst:numerofobjects}, caption={Example showing how you can create object in the whole map.}]
        <OBJECTS_GENERATION>
        create_object GOLD {
            number_of_objects 10
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{number\_of\_groups} NUM}

    Place a number of objects grouped together. Note that the total number of objects added is $n \cdot g$, where $n$ is \term{number\_of\_objects} and $g$ is the \term{number\_of\_groups}. \lstref{lst:numerofgroups} allows to generate 20 groups of gold mines, each with 5 patches of gold.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms}, label={lst:numerofgroups}, caption={Example showing how you can create object in the whole map, grouped together.}]
        <OBJECTS_GENERATION>
        create_object GOLD {
            number_of_objects 5
            number_of_groups 20
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{groups\_variance} NUM}

    The \term{number\_of\_objects} is randomly varied up to $\pm$ the amount specified. Note that this is not the mathematically variance, but the standard deviation.
    Each group generated has a different number of objects. \lstref{lst:groupvariance} allows to generate 10 groups of gold mines, each with patches of $5 \pm 3$ gold.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language={rms}, label={lst:groupvariance}, caption={Example showing how you can create different groups of object in the whole map, with different number of objects in each group.}]
        <OBJECTS_GENERATION>
        create_object GOLD {
            number_of_objects 5
            number_of_groups 10
            group_variance 3
            set_tight_grouping
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{\term{resource\_delta} NUM}

    TODO

    \paragraph{\term{second\_object} OBJECT}

    \section{Functions}

    The section provides the utility functions you can use within \acrref{RMS} file.

    \subsection{Random}

    If you need to generate a random number, use \code{rnd} function.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item min: the minimum number that the function can generate;
        \item max: the maximum number that the function can generate;
    \end{enumerate}
    It generates a number $x \in [min,max]$. The example in \lstref{rms:rnd} yields numbers in the set $\{5,6,7\}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=rms,label=rms:rnd]
        foobar rnd(5,7)
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{Choose a randomly chosen scenario}

    If you need to perform a different command depending on a randomly generated number, you can use the construct \term{start\_random}, \term{end\_random}, as shown in \lstref{rms:startrandom}: such a construct will set \code{FOO} to 3 in the 25\% of the cases, 4 in the 25\% of the cases and 5 in the remainder 50\% of cases.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=rms,label=rms:startrandom]
        start_random
            percent_chance 25 #const FOO 3
            percent_chance 25 #const FOO 4
            percent_change 50 #const FOO 5
        end_random
    \end{lstlisting}

    \section{Inherited constants from the environment}

    When building a map, it is possible to use conditional in order to check what are the parameters of the map that we need to generate. For example, you may want to obtain how big the map to generate is (\eg{} tiny, normal, ludicruous). To do so, you can check whether one of the macro in \tblref{tbl:mapsizemacro} is defined.

    \begin{table}
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \toprule
            Map size name & Macro to check \\
            \midrule
            Tiny & TINY\_MAP \\
            Tiny & SMALL\_MAP \\
            Tiny & MEDIUM\_MAP \\
            Tiny & LARGE\_MAP \\
            Tiny & HUGE\_MAP \\
            Tiny & GIGANTIC\_MAP \\
            Tiny & LUDIKRIS\_MAP \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Macro to check if you want to detect the map size}
        \label{tbl:mapsizemacro}
    \end{table}

    \section{Popular included files}

    \subsection{thebr\_setup.inc}

    Seems empty

    \subsection{F\_seasons.inc}

    You can include \code{F\_seasons.inc} file. Such a file changes the texture of the random map, depending on which macros are defined: \tblref{tbl:seasons} shows which macros should be define in order to tweak the aesthetic of the map. Usually you need to first define one of the macros and then import \code{F\_seasons.inc} (via \term{include\_drs}).
