\chapter{Introduction}

This guide helps you creating a new mod in \aoe{}: by reading this file, you should be able to create simple mods. I have written this guide when I started my \aoe{} modding experience and contains all the information I have gathered while scouting the internet. I tried to include the most important information, but I have decided to leave some other (albeit relevant) information out from this document. Hence, the data presented here may be lacking or missing.

Note that this guide focuses its attention on \aoe{}, while other version of the game (\eg{} Age of Conqueror or HD version) are explicitly not considered whatsoever: this usually means that some functions or characteristics may not be available in such game versions. The work here has been done in order to fix the stable bug from \dquote{Persistent Corpses} data mod\cite{steamid:2019} and in order to create more team maps where me and my friend can play in.

All code (alongside the source code of this document) is available at \url{https://github.com/Koldar/aoe-mod-tutorial}: please open an issue whenever you find any typos, missing references of false information.
